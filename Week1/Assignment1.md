## Part 1:
1. AIOps vs. MLOps
Although ML is just one application of AI, AIOps and MLOps have stark differences within an organization.<br>
AIOps is concerned with improving the efficiency of IT operations. The imporovement in efficiency is achieved by automating several IT tasks such as incident diagnostics, Management diagnostics, root cause analysis, anomaly detection with the help of AI. The trained AI models are fed with the data coming from IT operations and in turn it gives the technical teams high quality information that is easy to understand. This helps in getting to a solution faster too.<br>
MLOps is concerned only with bridging the gap between ML experimentation and ML production. It looks to overcome the gap between data science, ML team and the IT team (Operations team) so as to get the ML models into production faster and more often.

With MLOps, the aim is to speed up the process of getting ML models into production whereas with AIOps, the aim is to speed up the IT operations with the help of AI. AIOps directly applies AI/ML to the IT operations whereas MLOps is more about streamlining the building, deployment and maintenance of the ML algorithms rather than focussing heavily on these algorithms alone.
